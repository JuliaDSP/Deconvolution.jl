Introduction
------------

This package provides a set of functions to
[deconvolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution) digital signals, like
images or time series.  This is written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/), a
modern high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language designed for
technical computing.

Installation
------------

The latest version of `Deconvolution.jl` is available for Julia 1.0 and later
versions, and can be installed with [Julia built-in package
manager](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/stable/).  In a Julia session, after
entering the package manager mode with `]`, run the command

```julia
pkg> add Deconvolution
```

Older versions are also available for Julia 0.4-0.7.

### Documentation

The complete manual of `Deconvolution.jl` is available at
[the documentation page][docs-stable-url]. It has more detailed explanation of
the methods used and the examples are complemented with pictures.

Usage
-----

Currently `Deconvolution.jl` provides only two methods, but others will come in
the future.

### `wiener`

```julia
wiener(input, signal, noise[, blurring])
```

The [Wiener deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_deconvolution)
attempts at reducing the noise in a digital signal by suppressing frequencies
with low
[signal-to-noise ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio).
The signal is assumed to be degraded by additive noise and a shift-invariant
blurring function.

The `wiener` function can be used to apply the Wiener deconvolution method to a
digital signal.  The arguments are:

* `input`: the digital signal
* `signal`: the original signal (or a signal with a luckily similar power
  spectrum)
* `noise`: the noise of the signal (or a noise with a luckily similar power
  spectrum)
* `blurring` (optional argument): the blurring kernel

All arguments must be arrays, all with the same size, and all of them in the
time/space domain (they will be converted to the frequency domain internally
using `fft` function).  Argument `noise` can be also a real number, in which
case a constant noise with that value will be assumed (this is a good
approximation in the case of
[white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise)).

### `lucy`

```julia
lucy(observed, psf[, iterations])
```

The [Richardson-Lucy deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson-Lucy_deconvolution)
is an iterative method based on Bayesian inference for restoration of signal
that is convolved with a point spread function.

The `lucy` function can be used to apply the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution
method to a digital signal. The arguments are:

* `observed`: the observed blurred signal
* `psf`: the point spread function (the blurring kernel)
* `iterations` (optional argument): the number of iterations

First two arguments must be arrays, all with the same size, and all of them
in the time/space domain (they will be converted to the frequency domain
internally using `fft` function).  Argument `iterations` is an integer number.
The more iterations is specified the better result should be if the solution
converges and it is going to converge if PSF is estimated well.

Examples
--------

### Wiener deconvolution

Here is an example of use of `wiener` function to perform the Wiener
deconvolution of an image, degraded with a blurring function and an additive
noise.

``` julia
using Images, TestImages, Deconvolution, FFTW, ImageView

# Open the test image
img = channelview(testimage("cameraman"))
# Create the blurring kernel in frequency domain
x = hcat(ntuple(x -> collect((1:512) .- 257), 512)...)
k = 0.001
blurring_ft = @. exp(-k*(x ^ 2 + x ^ 2)^(5//6))
# Create additive noise
noise = rand(Float64, size(img))
# Fourier transform of the blurred image, with additive noise
blurred_img_ft = fftshift(blurring_ft) .* fft(img) .+ fft(noise)
# Get the blurred image from its Fourier transform
blurred_img = real(ifft(blurred_img_ft))
# Get the blurring kernel in the space domain
blurring = ifft(fftshift(blurring_ft))
# Polish the image with Deconvolution deconvolution
polished = wiener(blurred_img, img, noise, blurring)

# Wiener deconvolution works also when you don't have the real image and noise,
# that is the most common and useful case.  This happens because the Wiener
# filter only cares about the power spectrum of the signal and the noise, so you
# don't need to have the exact signal and noise but something with a similar
# power spectrum.
img2 = channelview(testimage("livingroom")) # Load another image
noise2 = rand(Float64, size(img)) # Create another additive noise
# Polish the image with Deconvolution deconvolution
polished2 = wiener(blurred_img, img2, noise2, blurring)

# # Compare...
# imshow(img) # ...the original image
# imshow(blurred_img) # ...the blurred image
# imshow(polished) # ...the polished image
# imshow(polished2) # ...the second polished image
```
### Richardson-Lucy deconvolution

Here is an example of use of `lucy` function to perform the Richardson-Lucy
deconvolution of an image blurred by kernel that models spherical lens aberration.

``` julia
using Images, TestImages, Deconvolution, FFTW, ZernikePolynomials, ImageView

img = channelview(testimage("cameraman"))

# model of lens aberration
blurring = evaluateZernike(LinRange(-16,16,512), [12, 4, 0], [1.0, -1.0, 2.0], index=:OSA)
blurring = fftshift(blurring)
blurring = blurring ./ sum(blurring)

blurred_img = fft(img) .* fft(blurring) |> ifft |> real

@time restored_img = lucy(blurred_img, blurring, iterations=1000)

imshow(img)
imshow(blurring)
imshow(blurred_img)
imshow(restored_img)
```
